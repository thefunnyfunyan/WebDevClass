        I am truly sorry if you find this website boring. You see, I am not the most creative type<br/>
        I have a very analytical mind. I like to fix things and make things with my hands, out of <a class ="wood">wood</a>,<br/>
        <a class = "metal">metal</a>, or <a class = "binary">binary</a> (heh, see what I did there??). However all of these things come from someone<br/>
        who is much more "Creative" than I am.
