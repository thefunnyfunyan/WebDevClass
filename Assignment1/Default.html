        I am truly sorry if you find this website boring. You see, I am not the most creative type<br/>
        I have a very analytical mind. I like to fix things and make things with my hands, out of <a class ="wood">wood</a>,<br/>
        <a class = "metal">metal</a>, or <a class = "binary">binary</a> (heh, see what I did there??). However all of these things come from someone<br/>
        who is much more "Creative" than I am.

          Isn't it so cool? Maybe not. I don't even know what the picture is <br/>
          at the time of me writing this. Hmmm, planning is not my specialty.

        So I am a terrible planner. I found the rubber duck before actually <br />
        typing this.... ya know.... because its before hand... OOO well, what <br />
        are ya going to do? Maybe I will do some planning for the next section.

        Well in case you didn't realize before hand, I am a big fat liar. I<br />
        Had no intention of actually doing any planning before writing this<br />
        section. Sorry! This is usually what a team of artists do! I am so<br />
        uncreative it is really sad.
