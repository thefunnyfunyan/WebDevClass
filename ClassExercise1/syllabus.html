        <h1>Course Description</h1>
        <p>
          This course explores the standards, technologies, and
          strategies used in modern web application development.
          The ultimate goal is to develop the foundational theoretical
          and practical knowledge that will allow you to work with
          an endless variety of web stacks and frameworks, rather
          than focusing on a single technology or approach.
        </p>
        <p>
          We have a lot of ground to cover, so we will be moving
          very quickly through the material.  It is vital that
          you both keep up, and ask questions when you don't
          understand.  Make good use of office hours.
        </p>

      <section>
        <h1>Prerequisites</h1>
        <p>
          You should have completed CIS 501 with a C or better,
          and have the equivalent experience of CIS 125 with
          HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  If you do not, I strongly
          recommend you take a (free) crash course on HTML & CSS through
          <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/">https://www.codecademy.com/</a>
          or wait until you have taken CIS 125 before joining
          this course.

        <h1>Course Structure</h1>
        <p>
          In recognition of the importance of hands-on learning,
          this course utlizes a blended lecture/lab format, where
          theoretical understanding is immediately put to use
          programming software drawing upon that theoretical
          understanding.  Effective learning following this strategy
          <i>depends</i> upon active participation;
          accordingly, it is necessary to both attend class
          and participate in in-class activities to succeed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Further, we will be embracing  problem-based cooperative
          learning approaches at the midpoint of the semester
          where we will shift to small group work, developing an
          original and useful web application drawing upon the
          knowledge you have gained throughout the semester.  To
          help promote accountability, peer reviews from this phase
          will account for the equivalent of a letter grade.

          Each unexused absence will reduce the student's class participation
          grade by 10%.

        <h1>Subject to Change</h1>
        <p>
          The details in this document are not set in stone - there
          may need to be adjustments during the semester.  If this
          occurs, the changes will be posted to the classes' K-State
          Online page and emailed to all students.
        </p>
      </section>

      <section>
        <h1>Academic Honesty</h1>
        <p>
          Kansas State University has an Honor System based on personal
          integrity, which is presumed to be sufficient assurance that,
          in academic matters, one's work is performed honestly and
          without unauthorized assistance.  Undergraduate students,
          registration, acknowledge the jurisdiction of the Honor System
          The policies and procedures of the Honor System apply to all
          full and part-time students enrolled in undergraduate and
          graduate courses on-campus, off-campus, and via distance
          learning.  The honor system website can be reached via
          following url:
          <a href="http://www.k-state.edu/honor">www.k-state.edu/honor</a>.
          A component vital to the honor system is the inclusion of the
          Honor Pledge which applies to all assignments, examinations,
          or other course work undertaken by students.  The Honor Pledge
          is implied, whether or not it is stated: "On my honor, as a
          student, I have neither given nor recieved unauthorized aid on
          this academic work." A grade of XF can result from a breech of
          academic honesty.  The F indicates failure in the course, the
          X indicates the reason is an Honor Pledge violation.
